## 1. What Does It Mean to Be a Professional in ICT?
A **professional** is someone who:
1. Has **specialised knowledge and skills** in a field.
2. Works according to **ethical standards and codes of conduct**.
3. Provides services that affect **society, clients, and stakeholders**, often with serious consequences.
4. Accepts **accountability** for the quality and impact of their work.

> In ICT, being a professional means ensuring that technology is **safe, ethical, and beneficial** to society, beyond just writing code.

## 2. Job vs. Profession

| Feature | Job | Profession |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Done mainly for income. | Done to serve society while earning income. |
| **Training** | May not require specialized training. | Requires specialized knowledge & continuous learning. |
| **Ethics** | Few obligations beyond company rules. | Guided by strict ethical codes (e.g., ACM, IEEE). |
| **Accountability** | Only to the employer. | To clients, public, regulators, and society. |

**Example:**
* **Job:** A part-time web developer freelancing without long-term accountability.
* **Profession:** A licensed software engineer building hospital record systems, ensuring safety and compliance.

## 3. Professional Responsibilities (ACM Code Section 2)

The ACM lists **nine professional responsibilities**. Below are the explanations and the lessons learned when these are neglected.



### 2.1 Strive for High Quality
* **Meaning:** Produce high-quality work and resist cutting corners. Respect the right of stakeholders to have transparent communication.
* **Case:** *Boeing 737 MAX crashes* – Poorly tested software led to 346 deaths.
* **Lesson:** Poor quality in ICT can cost lives.

### 2.2 Maintain High Standards of Competence
* **Meaning:** Keep learning and stay updated in both technical and social contexts of your work.
* **Case:** *Equifax Data Breach (2017)* – Failure to apply a known patch led to the theft of 147M records.
* **Lesson:** Professionals must remain competent to protect stakeholders.

### 2.3 Respect Existing Rules
* **Meaning:** Follow laws and policies unless they are unethical; challenge harmful rules responsibly.
* **Case:** *Google Street View Wi-Fi scandal* – Secretly collected private Wi-Fi data, violating privacy laws.
* **Lesson:** Ignoring regulations damages public trust.

### 2.4 Accept and Provide Review
* **Meaning:** Seek peer reviews and provide constructive feedback at all stages.
* **Case:** *Heartbleed Bug (2014)* – A critical vulnerability went unnoticed for years due to insufficient review.
* **Lesson:** Peer review prevents catastrophic errors.

### 2.5 Give Comprehensive Risk Evaluations
* **Meaning:** Objectively assess and communicate risks of systems, especially in AI and automation.
* **Case:** *Tesla Autopilot crashes* – Marketed as safer than it was, leading to fatalities.
* **Lesson:** Risk transparency is vital for trust.

### 2.6 Work Only in Areas of Competence
* **Meaning:** Accept work only if qualified; disclose limitations immediately if expertise is lacking.
* **Case:** *Unregulated health apps* – Developers without medical knowledge built unsafe diagnostic tools.
* **Lesson:** Working outside expertise endangers users.

### 2.7 Foster Public Awareness
* **Meaning:** Help society understand the risks and opportunities of computing.
* **Case:** *Deepfakes* – A public unaware of AI capabilities is more vulnerable to misinformation.
* **Lesson:** Professionals have a duty to educate the public.

### 2.8 Access Resources Only When Authorized
* **Meaning:** Do not access systems or data without permission, unless justified for the public good.
* **Case:** *Edward Snowden (2013)* – Leaked classified NSA data; a complex example of an ethical vs. illegal dilemma.
* **Lesson:** Unauthorized access has massive moral and legal consequences.

### 2.9 Design Secure Systems
* **Meaning:** Prioritize robust, usable security from design through deployment and provide timely breach notifications.
* **Case:** *Yahoo breach (2013–14)* – 3B accounts hacked due to weak security practices.
* **Lesson:** Security is an ethical responsibility, not an afterthought.
