# Lesson 2.2: Ethical Theories in ICT Decision-Making

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Define and explain** Utilitarianism, Deontology, and Virtue Ethics.
* **Apply** each theory to ICT-related ethical dilemmas.
* **Critically evaluate** the DCI FlexiSpy case through different ethical lenses.
* **Reflect** on how these theories influence professional decision-making.

## 📖 1. Introduction
Ethical theories provide structured ways of thinking about right and wrong. In ICT practice, professionals often face dilemmas where legality, morality, and ethics conflict—as seen in the **DCI’s alleged surveillance of journalists using FlexiSpy**. 

The fundamental question we must ask is: **Even if the law permits an action, is it ethically right?**

## ⚖️ 2. The Three Pillars of Ethical Theory

### a) Utilitarianism (Consequentialism)
* **Principle:** An action is right if it produces the "greatest good for the greatest number." It focuses entirely on the **outcome**.
* **ICT Implication:** A professional might justify a security patch that slows down a system if it protects 99% of users from a hack.
* **FlexiSpy Case Analysis:**
    * **Pro-Surveillance:** If spying on a few journalists prevents a major national security threat, the "utility" (safety) of the majority outweighs the privacy of the few.
    * **Anti-Surveillance:** The long-term harm to press freedom and public trust creates more "pain" for society than the "pleasure" of the data gathered.

### b) Deontology (Duty-Based Ethics)
* **Principle:** An action is right if it follows universal moral rules and duties, regardless of the consequences.
* **ICT Implication:** If the rule is "Do not lie," a developer must be honest about a system flaw even if it costs the company a million-dollar contract.
* **FlexiSpy Case Analysis:** * Installing spyware without informed consent violates the fundamental **duty to respect privacy**. From a deontological view, this is wrong regardless of whether it catches a criminal.

### c) Virtue Ethics (Character-Based Ethics)
* **Principle:** Ethics is about cultivating virtuous traits like honesty, courage, and integrity. It asks: *"What kind of person/organization do we become if we do this?"*
* **ICT Implication:** A "virtuous" programmer writes clean, documented code not because they are told to, but because they value **excellence** and **accountability**.
* **FlexiSpy Case Analysis:**
    * By using secret spyware, an organization moves away from the virtues of **transparency** and **justice**, instead cultivating a culture of **secrecy** and **deception**.

## 🔍 3. Comparison Table: Ethical Lenses in ICT

| Theory | Focus | Core Question | ICT Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Utilitarianism** | Consequences / Outcomes | Does this benefit the majority? | Implementing a feature that collects data to improve service for millions. |
| **Deontology** | Rules / Duties | Does this follow the "Code of Ethics"? | Refusing to share user data because the Privacy Policy forbids it. |
| **Virtue Ethics** | Character / Integrity | What does this say about my character? | Reporting a bug voluntarily because you value professional excellence. |

## 4. Application: Navigating the FlexiSpy Dilemma

When we look at the DCI case through these combined lenses, we see why it is so controversial:

1.  **Utilitarianism** provides the state's potential defense (Safety > Individual Privacy).
2.  **Deontology** provides the professional's defense (Privacy = A Universal Right).
3.  **Virtue Ethics** provides the societal critique (Secrecy = Lack of Integrity).

## 5. Summary Reflection
As an ICT professional, you will rarely use just one theory. Most experts use a **pluralistic approach**:
* Use **Deontology** to check if you are breaking any fundamental professional rules.
* Use **Utilitarianism** to see the potential impact on the community.
* Use **Virtue Ethics** to ensure you are becoming the kind of professional the industry respects.
