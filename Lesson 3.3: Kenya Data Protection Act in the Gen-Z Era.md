## 1. Background: Personal Data is Power
In the Gen-Z era, your data—likes, location, and search history—is a commodity. Kenya passed the **Data Protection Act (2019)** to ensure this power isn't abused.

### 🔑 Core Principles (Section 25)


| Principle | Meaning for Gen-Z |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lawful & Transparent** | You must be told *exactly* why your data is being taken. |
| **Data Minimization** | A flashlight app shouldn't ask for your contact list. |
| **Purpose Limitation** | If you give your number for a delivery, they shouldn't add you to a marketing WhatsApp group. |
| **Integrity & Confidentiality** | Your private "Archives" and "DMs" must be technically secured by the platform. |

## 2. Case Study: Gen-Z Protests (2024–2025)
The #RejectFinanceBill protests highlighted a major tension: **National Security vs. Individual Privacy.**

* **The Incident:** Protesters reported being tracked via mobile data. In court, evidence emerged of telcos providing location details to security agencies without clear warrants or user consent.
* **The Ethical Conflict:** While the state cites "security," the DPA requires transparency.
* **The Reality Check:** Even with a strong law, enforcement is often bypassed by state interests, creating a "privacy gap."

## 3. Everyday Digital Violations

### 🔹 Recording & Posting Without Consent
Recording a stranger for a "street interview" or capturing someone in the background of your TikTok without permission can be a violation of the DPA. Under Kenyan law, an image of a face is **Personal Data**.

### 🔹 Posting Minors
Posting children under 18 without parental consent is a direct violation. The Act (and the Children's Act 2022) views the "Best Interest of the Child" as the highest priority.

### 🔹 Screen Recording Private Chats
Taking a screenshot of a "Once View" photo or a private WhatsApp conversation and sharing it publicly may be considered an unauthorized processing of personal data.

## 4. Legal Landmark: Wanjiru vs. Machakos University (2022)
This case set the precedent for **Image Rights** in Kenya.

**The Case:** Machakos University used a student's graduation photo for a commercial advertisement for computer packages without her consent.
**The Court's Ruling:**
1.  **Violation of Privacy:** The university used her image for financial gain without authority.
2.  **Intellectual Property:** Her "personality rights" (the right to control her likeness) were infringed.
3.  **The Penalty:** The university was ordered to pay **Ksh 700,000** in damages.

> **Key Takeaway:** Your face is your data. Using it for business without your "Yes" is expensive for the offender.

## 5. Your Rights as a Data Subject


1.  **Right to be Informed:** "Why are you taking my photo?"
2.  **Right of Access:** "Show me what data you have on me."
3.  **Right to Erasure:** "Delete my account and all associated data permanently." (The Right to be Forgotten).
4.  **Right to Object:** "Stop sending me promotional SMS every Friday night."

## 6. Summary Reflection
The law exists on paper, but **privacy culture** is built by users. As future ICT professionals:
* Will you build "backdoors" for surveillance?
* Will you design apps that "scrape" more data than they need?
* Will you respect the "Right to be Forgotten" in the systems you build?
