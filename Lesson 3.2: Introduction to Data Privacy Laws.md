# Lesson 3.2: Introduction to Data Privacy Laws (GDPR & Kenya DPA 2019)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Define** data and differentiate between personal, sensitive, and non-sensitive data.
* **Explain** data privacy and why it is a non-negotiable pillar of ICT systems.
* **Describe** the role of data privacy laws in protecting individuals and organizations.
* **Analyze** real-life Kenyan case studies (Huduma Namba & the KICC Iris Scan incident).

## 1. Why Data Privacy Matters
Data is the digital footprint of a human being. From phone numbers to biometric identifiers, data reveals our identities, habits, and choices.
* **The Risk:** Without protection, citizens face **identity theft**, companies **abuse power**, and **public trust** in systems like mobile money evaporates.

## 2. What is Data?
Data consists of raw facts and figures. In ICT, we must classify data to determine the required level of security:

| Data Type | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Personal Data** | Information that can identify a specific person. | Names, Phone Numbers, National ID Numbers. |
| **Sensitive Data** | Data that could cause significant harm if misused. | **Biometrics** (Iris scans, DNA), Health records, Religion. |
| **Non-Sensitive** | Anonymized data that cannot identify a person. | General usage statistics, aggregate census data. |

## 3. What is Data Privacy?
**Data Privacy** is the right of individuals to control their own information. It is governed by four core pillars:

1.  **Consent:** Users must agree to the collection.
2.  **Purpose Limitation:** Use data *only* for what you said you would.
3.  **Data Minimization:** Don't collect what you don't need.
4.  **Security:** Protect the data you do collect from hackers or misuse.

> **Example:** When signing up for M-Pesa, Safaricom uses your ID for KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance. Data privacy ensures they don't sell that ID number to third-party advertisers without your permission.

## 4. Key Data Privacy Frameworks
Laws provide the guidelines for ethical data use and set penalties for those who fail.

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, EU):** The global "gold standard." It gives individuals the "Right to be Forgotten" and mandates heavy fines for breaches.
* **Kenya Data Protection Act (2019):** Established the **Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC)**. It mandates that all high-risk systems undergo a **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**.

## 5. Case Study Analysis

### Case A: Huduma Namba (NIIMS)
* **The Issue:** A biometric ID system launched without a proper DPIA or adequate legal framework.
* **The Result:** The High Court ruled it **illegal** in 2021 until the government complied with the 2019 Act.
* **The Lesson:** Innovation is not an excuse to skip privacy safeguards.

### Case B: KICC Iris Scan Incident (Worldcoin)
* **The Issue:** Mass harvesting of iris scans at KICC without transparency regarding purpose, ownership, or storage.
* **The Result:** Highlighted how easily data collection can cross into **exploitation** when citizens are not fully informed.
* **The Lesson:** Sensitive biometric data requires the highest level of professional transparency.

## 6. Why ICT Professionals Must Care
* **Legal Liability:** You (and your company) can be sued or fined under the DPA 2019.
* **Public Trust:** If people don't trust the app, they won't use it.
* **Human Rights:** Your responsibility goes beyond "making the code work"—it includes protecting the person behind the data.
