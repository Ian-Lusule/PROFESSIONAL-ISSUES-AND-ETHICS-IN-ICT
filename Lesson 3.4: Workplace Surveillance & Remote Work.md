# Lesson 3.4: Case Study – Amazon France Logistique

The rise of remote work and high-tech logistics has led to "Algorithmic Management," where software—rather than humans—monitors every second of a worker's day. The **Amazon France** case serves as a warning for ICT professionals designing such systems.

## 1. Details of the Case
**The System:** Employees used handheld scanners to log every action (stowing, packing, etc.). 
**The Overreach:** The system didn't just track work; it tracked **non-work**.
* **"Idle Time":** The scanner recorded downtime to the nearest second.
* **"Stow Machine Gun":** An indicator that flagged an "error" if an employee scanned an item too quickly (less than 1.25 seconds apart), under the theory that speed causes mistakes.
* **Massive Retention:** Detailed logs were kept for **31 days**, allowing supervisors to micro-analyze an employee's entire month.

## 2. The Conflict: Efficiency vs. Dignity
While Amazon argued these tools were necessary for warehouse safety and logistics speed, the French Data Protection Authority (**CNIL**) found them "excessively intrusive."

### Key GDPR Violations:
1.  **Data Minimization:** Was it necessary to record *every* 10-minute break for a month? CNIL said no—aggregated weekly statistics would have sufficed.
2.  **Lawfulness & Proportionality:** Measuring scan speed to the millisecond was ruled disproportionate. It creates a "state of permanent surveillance" that harms mental health.
3.  **Transparency:** Temporary workers weren't properly informed about how their biometric/scanner data was being used.

**The Outcome:** Amazon was fined **€32 Million** and forced to reduce its data retention periods.

## 3. Applying the Ethics to the Kenya Context
Although this happened in France, **Kenya’s Data Protection Act (2019)** uses the same principles of Lawfulness, Transparency, and Proportionality.

### The "Remote Work" Dilemma in Kenya
As more Kenyans work remotely for global or local firms, we see similar monitoring trends:
* **Screen Recording:** Softwares like Hubstaff or Time Doctor that take screenshots every 10 minutes.
* **Keystroke Logging:** Tracking how many words you type per minute.
* **Camera "Always On":** Requiring employees to be on a live Zoom call all day.

### Comparison: GDPR vs. Kenya DPA 2019
| Feature | GDPR (EU) | Kenya DPA 2019 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Principle** | Proportionality & Dignity | Lawfulness & Fair Processing |
| **Max Fine** | Up to €20M or 4% of Turnover | Up to Ksh 5 Million or 1% of Turnover |
| **Employee Rights** | Right to be informed of surveillance | Right to object to "unwarranted intrusion" |

## 4. Ethical Lessons for ICT Professionals
If you are asked to build a monitoring tool, ask yourself these "Virtue Ethics" questions:
* **Is it necessary?** Can I track productivity using *outcomes* (tasks completed) instead of *surveillance* (keystrokes)?
* **Is it transparent?** Have the employees signed a policy that explains this specific tool?
* **Is it dignified?** Does this tool treat the human as a person or as a "machine component"?

> **Legal Reality:** In the case of **Wanjiru vs. Machakos University**, Kenyan courts proved they are willing to fine organizations for using personal data without consent. An intrusive workplace tracker is just one lawsuit away from a similar penalty.

## 5. Summary: Surveillance Checklist
Before implementing workplace monitoring in a Kenyan organization:
1.  **Conduct a DPIA:** Evaluate the risk to employee mental health and privacy.
2.  **Ensure Transparency:** Publish a clear "Employee Privacy Policy."
3.  **Minimize:** Collect only the data you need for the shift, not for a month.
