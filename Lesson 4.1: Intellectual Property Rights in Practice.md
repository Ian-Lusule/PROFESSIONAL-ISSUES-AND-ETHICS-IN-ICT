# Lesson 4.1: IP in Practice — TikTok Strikes & Safaricom Disputes

## 🎯 Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Recognize** how copyright infringement functions on automated platforms like TikTok.
* **Analyze** Kenyan IP disputes involving major tech players like Safaricom.
* **Connect** real-world cases with concepts like **Fair Use**, **Licensing**, and **Independent Creation**.
* **Reflect** on the professional necessity of documenting source code and ownership.

## 1. Case Study A: TikTok Copyright Strikes
Social media platforms use automated algorithms to protect Intellectual Property. Understanding these rules is vital for any content creator or digital marketer.

### How the "Strike" System Works
When you upload a video, TikTok scans it for copyrighted music, video clips, or choreography.
* **The Notification:** If a violation is found, the content is muted or removed, and the user is notified.
* **The "3-Strike" Rule:** Accumulating three strikes for the same IP type (Copyright or Trademark) can lead to a **permanent account ban**.
* **The Appeal:** Users can submit an appeal if they believe the use falls under **Fair Use** or if they possess a valid **License**.

### Key Teaching Points:
* **Scope:** Copyright covers more than music; it includes your dance moves (choreography), video editing style, and specific sound recordings.
* **The "Short Clip" Myth:** Posting even 5–10 seconds of a song without permission can still trigger a strike if it is not transformative or licensed.

## 2. Case Study B: The Safaricom App Disputes
In Kenya, software is protected as a **Literary Work** under the Copyright Act. However, proving you "own" an app is harder than it looks.

### Case 1: Solut Technology Ltd vs. Safaricom (Thibitisha vs. Wavu)
* **The Dispute:** Solut claimed Safaricom’s "Thibitisha" app was a copy of their "Wavu" app, which they had pitched through Safaricom’s *Zindua Cafe* portal.
* **The Outcome:** The case was **dismissed**.
* **The Lesson:** The court found that Solut could not prove copyright ownership (e.g., they lacked source code evidence). Safaricom successfully argued **Independent Development**—that they built the app on their own without using Solut's specific expression.

### Case 2: Muoki & Beluga Ltd vs. Safaricom (M-Teen)
* **The Dispute:** Innovators sued over Safaricom’s "Manage Child Account," claiming it was a derivative of their "M-Teen" pitch. 
* **The Status:** Unlike the Wavu case, the court allowed this to proceed, showing that if enough evidence exists, small startups *can* challenge tech giants.

### Case 3: Peter Oyier vs. Safaricom (Voice Licensing)
* **The Dispute:** A radio anchor sued Safaricom for using his IVR voice recordings after his license expired.
* **The Lesson:** **Licensing has an expiry date.** Using professional work beyond the agreed period is unauthorized use and subject to damages.

## 3. Comparison of IP Concepts

| Concept | Application | Real-World Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Copyright** | Protects the *expression* of an idea. | The actual Python or Java code of an app. |
| **Trademark** | Protects brand identity (logos/names). | The Safaricom "S" logo or the name "M-PESA." |
| **Licensing** | A contract allowing specific use. | Paying a voice actor for 2 years of IVR usage. |
| **Independent Creation** | Building something similar by coincidence. | Two companies building a "Chat" app at the same time. |

## 4. Why This Matters for Kenyan ICT Professionals
1.  **Protect Your Code:** Formal registration isn't mandatory, but keeping **Git logs** and **stamped documentation** is essential to prove you wrote the code first.
2.  **Beware of "Zindua" Terms:** When pitching to big companies, read the Terms and Conditions. Some portals state that by submitting, you **waive** certain rights to the idea.
3.  **Respect Licensing:** As a developer, ensure any libraries, music, or assets you use in your app are properly licensed for commercial use.

## 5. Discussion & Reflection
* **Scenario:** If you use a 10-second viral sound for a TikTok ad for your startup, is that Fair Use? 
* **Debate:** Was Safaricom's defense of "independent development" in the Solut case fair, or do big companies have an unfair advantage in "absorbing" ideas from pitches?
