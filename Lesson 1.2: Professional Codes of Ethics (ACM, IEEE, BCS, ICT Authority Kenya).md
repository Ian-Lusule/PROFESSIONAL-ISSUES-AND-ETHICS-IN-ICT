## 1. Introduction
Building on Lesson 1.1, we know that professions are defined by specialized knowledge and service to society. This lesson focuses on **professional codes of ethics**—the "moral compass" documents that outline the values, principles, and expected behaviors of ICT professionals. 

Just as doctors follow the **Hippocratic Oath**, ICT practitioners rely on these codes to guide decisions where the law may be silent or unclear.

## 2. What is a Professional Code of Ethics?
A professional code of ethics:
* States the **principles and core values** essential to the work.
* Serves as a **moral compass** for consistency, fairness, and integrity.
* **Goes beyond laws**—addressing issues like AI bias, privacy invasion, or algorithmic transparency that legislation may not yet cover.
* Defines what the profession **aspires to become**.

## 3. Benefits of a Code of Ethics
1. **Ethical Decision-Making:** Offers core values to help handle dilemmas (e.g., reporting a data breach).
2. **High Standards:** Acts as a constant reminder of professional duties and acceptable behavior.
3. **Public Trust:** Builds credibility; society is more likely to adopt technology from trusted, ethical developers.
4. **Evaluation Benchmark:** Provides a tool for self-assessment, peer review, and organizational evaluation.

## 4. Comparison of Key ICT Codes of Ethics

| Organization | Primary Focus | Key Case Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ACM** (Association for Computing Machinery) | Human well-being, honesty, and avoiding harm. | Reporting a vulnerability in a hospital system even if management resists. |
| **IEEE** (Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers) | Advancing technology for humanity; fairness and avoiding bias. | Refusing to design an AI recruitment system that discriminates against certain demographics. |
| **BCS** (British Computer Society) | Public interest above all; professional competence and integrity. | Refusing to ship insecure software regardless of client pressure. |
| **ICT Authority Kenya** | Localized integrity, competence, and accountability in ICT resources. | Protecting citizens' private data (e.g., Huduma Namba) from political misuse. |

## 5. Laws vs. Codes of Ethics

| Feature | Laws | Codes of Ethics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enforcement** | Enforced by the government/state. | Enforced by professional bodies. |
| **Penalties** | Fines, imprisonment, or legal sanctions. | Disciplinary action or loss of membership. |
| **Scope** | Sets the **minimum** legal requirement. | Aims for **excellence** and moral leadership. |

> **Summary:** While laws set the floor for behavior, ethics set the ceiling. Together, they provide a comprehensive guide for the modern ICT professional.

## 6. Summary
* Codes of ethics are foundational for ICT professionalism.
* They ensure technology development benefits society and goes beyond simple legal compliance.
* Major bodies (ACM, IEEE, BCS, ICTA) all converge on **integrity, public interest, and responsibility**.
