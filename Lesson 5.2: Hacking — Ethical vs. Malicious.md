# Lesson 5.2: Hacking — Ethical vs. Malicious

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives
* **Define** hacking and distinguish between White Hat, Black Hat, and Gray Hat hackers.
* **Examine** Kenyan case studies (JKUAT and Betting Firm hacks) to identify criminal boundaries.
* **Apply** the *Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (2018)* to real-world scenarios.
* **Evaluate** the professional responsibilities of security researchers.

## 1. What is Hacking?
Hacking is the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a computer system or network. It is not always a crime; the "color of the hat" determines the ethics.

### The Hacking Spectrum
| Type | Motivation | Legality | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **White Hat** | Security improvement | **Legal** | Hired as a professional to find and fix bugs with permission. |
| **Black Hat** | Personal gain/Malice | **Illegal** | Breaks into systems to steal data or money without consent. |
| **Gray Hat** | Curiosity/Bounty | **Illegal/Grey** | Finds bugs without permission but reports them rather than exploiting. |

## 2. Kenyan Case Study 1: JKUAT Students & NCBA Bank
In a landmark 2020 case, two IT students from **Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT)** were charged with hacking into **NCBA Bank**.

* **The Incident:** They allegedly exploited a "system hitch" to steal **KES 24.4 million** and were accused of attempting to move an additional **KES 190.7 million**.
* **The Defense:** One student claimed he was a "white hat" who had alerted the bank to the glitch via Twitter before the money moved.
* **The Verdict:** The court emphasized that **unauthorized access coupled with the movement of funds** constitutes a crime. Even if a flaw exists, using it to enrich yourself is malicious hacking.

## 3. Kenyan Case Study 2: The Gen-Z Betting Firm Hack
A 26-year-old was arrested for allegedly hacking into a major Kenyan betting firm (**Betika**) and stealing **KES 11.4 million**.

* **The Tactic:** The hacker reportedly used digital trails to divert funds from the firm’s internal systems.
* **Professional Lesson:** Despite being hailed as a "genius" on social media, the act is a direct violation of the **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act**. 
* **The Fallout:** Malicious hacking against financial infrastructure carries enhanced penalties because it threatens national financial stability.

## 4. Legal Framework: Computer Misuse & Cybercrimes Act (2018)
As an ICT professional, you must be aware of these specific sections:

* **Section 14 (Unauthorized Access):** Intentionally bypassing security measures to gain access to a system. 
  * *Penalty:* Up to **KES 5 Million** fine or **3 years** in prison.
* **Section 15 (Access with Intent):** Accessing a system to commit a further crime (like theft).
  * *Penalty:* Up to **KES 10 Million** fine or **10 years** in prison.
* **Section 20 (Enhanced Penalties):** If you hack "protected systems" (Banks, Hospitals, Government), the fine can reach **KES 25 Million** and **20 years** in prison.

## 5. Ethical Responsibilities of the Security Professional
If you discover a vulnerability, follow these **Responsible Disclosure** steps:
1. **Never exploit it:** Do not move funds, download private data, or "test" the limits.
2. **Check for Bug Bounties:** See if the company has a "Responsible Disclosure Policy."
3. **Report Privately:** Alert the company’s security team directly.
4. **Wait for a Patch:** Do not post the vulnerability on social media until it is fixed.

## 🗣️ Discussion & Activity

### Discussion Prompt
*In the JKUAT case, if the student really did alert the bank on Twitter first, does that make him a hero or still a criminal? Does a "public alert" count as permission to enter a system?*

### Group Activity: Scope of Work (10 mins)
**Scenario:** You are hired as a "Penetration Tester" for a hospital. Your contract says "Test the Web Server." While testing, you find a door into the "Patient Record Database." 
1. Do you enter the database to prove it's vulnerable? 
2. Why or why not based on the **ACM Code of Ethics**?
