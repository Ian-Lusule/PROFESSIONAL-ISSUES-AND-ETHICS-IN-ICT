What the Case Was About
Parties:
• Dr. Peter Odero Akuon (Applicant / Requester)
• Safaricom PLC (1st Respondent)
• National Commercial Bank of Africa (NCBA) (2nd Respondent)
• Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) (3rd Respondent) Kenya Law+1Links to an external site.

Invention / Patent at Issue:
Akuon claimed a patent titled “Mobile Virtual Bank Account Management” (Patent No. KE 842), filed via national application KE/P/2017/2769, with a priority date of April 12, 2017. 
His invention proposed a system where a subscriber’s account (via mobile network) is linked to a virtual bank account (not a conventional bank account) and accessed via USSD, app, SIM Toolkit, etc. 

What Akuon Alleged / Reliefs Sought:
He alleged that Safaricom (with NCBA & KCB) infringed his patent by offering the Fuliza M-Pesa overdraft facility, which he claimed embodied features of his patent. He sought, among other reliefs:
• Injunctions to stop further offering of the infringing product
• A prohibition on further use until license
• Account of profits, damages, royalties
• Costs of suit 

Defence by Safaricom & Others:
The Respondents denied infringement. Key defences included:
• Fuliza is not a “virtual bank account” as in the patent; it is a credit facility, not a full bank account 
• Their system architecture, processes, and features differ materially from the claimed patent features 
• Challenges to the validity of Akuon’s patent: arguments of lack of novelty, inventive step, and possible exclusion under “business method / scheme / method of doing business” (which the Industrial Property Act may exclude) 

Counterclaims / Revocation Requests:
Respondents also filed counterrequests under Section 103 of the Industrial Property Act to revoke/invalidate Akuon’s patent on grounds of non-novelty, lack of inventive step, or ambiguity in claims.

What the Tribunal Ruled
The Industrial Property Tribunal (IPT) dismissed Akuon’s claim of infringement. It found that he failed to prove that Fuliza embodied the specific features claimed in his patent, or that the Respondents had directly copied his invention. 

The Tribunal also considered the revocation requests and held that parts of Akuon’s patent claims were vulnerable due to overlap with prior art and lack of sufficient inventive distinction. His claims did not sufficiently distinguish from known systems or prior patent literature. 

Overall, the Tribunal did not find the elements necessary to grant the reliefs sought (injunctions, damages, royalties). 

What This Teaches Us in Your Course
Strong proof / evidence is critical
Simply alleging similarity is not enough. The claimant must map each feature of the accused product to the patent claims, showing that the infringement is real. Without clear documentary evidence (source code, design docs, logs) claims are weak.

Novelty & Inventive Step Matter
Even if you file a patent, if parts of it are already in prior art (existing systems, publicly known technologies), your claim may be invalidated or fail. Understanding prior art is a key duty for inventors and professionals.

Claim drafting is central
The exact wording of claims defines the boundary of protection. Ambiguities, overbroad claims, or claims that attempt to cover business methods may be rejected or challenged.

Defense arguments include independent development and prior art
Respondents can contend that they developed the product independently, or that the patent claims too broadly cover things already known or practiced elsewhere.

Patent protection is not absolute
Even a granted patent can be challenged and revoked. Patent enforcement is expensive, complicated, and uncertain. Professionals must balance patenting with risk.

Relevance to software & fintech development
In the digital/ICT field, patents often overlap with software, fintech, business methods, and system/process claims. Knowing how courts treat such claims—especially in a developing economy—is vital for responsible design and innovation.

Ethical / professional implications
As future ICT professionals, you should:
• Keep thorough documentation, version control, timestamping, and development logs.
• Be transparent about your design choices, avoid adopting others’ ideas without permission.
• Understand the IP environment so you can responsibly innovate or negotiate licensing.
