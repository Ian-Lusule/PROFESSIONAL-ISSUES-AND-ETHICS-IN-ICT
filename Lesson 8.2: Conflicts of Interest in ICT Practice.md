# Lesson 8.2: Conflicts of Interest in ICT Practice

## 🎯 Lesson Overview
A **Conflict of Interest (COI)** arises when personal, financial, or secondary interests interfere—or appear to interfere—with a professional’s duty to act objectively. In the ICT sector, where decisions affect data privacy and public safety, maintaining impartiality is a core professional requirement.

## 1. Defining Conflict of Interest (COI)
A conflict of interest occurs when an ICT professional’s **personal interests** compete with their **professional responsibilities**, affecting—or appearing to affect—their judgment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A conflict exists **even if no unethical action has taken place**. The mere *risk* to impartial decision-making is enough to constitute a conflict.

## 2. The Three Types of Conflicts

| Type | Definition | ICT Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Actual** | A real and direct conflict that **already** affects judgment. | An IT manager awarding a contract to their spouse's startup. |
| **Potential** | A situation that **could** lead to a conflict in the future. | A developer reviewing a tool while interviewing for a job at that vendor. |
| **Perceived** | A situation that **appears** unethical to outsiders, regardless of intent. | A lead analyst auditing a project where their sibling is the lead coder. |

## 3. Why Perception Matters in ICT
In computing, **Trust** is our primary currency. If a public-facing system (like a national voting platform or a banking app) is designed by someone with a perceived conflict, the public may reject the technology entirely, even if the code is perfect.

## 4. Common COI Scenarios in ICT Practice

1.  **Procurement & Vendor Selection:** Accepting "kickbacks," gifts, or favoring a vendor due to personal ties.
2.  **Moonlighting:** Working for a competitor or using your employer’s proprietary code for your side-hustle.
3.  **Insider Information:** Using knowledge of a pending system upgrade or a security vulnerability for personal financial gain.
4.  **AI & Research Bias:** Highlighting only the strengths of an algorithm you developed while hiding its biases to ensure its adoption.

## 5. Lessons from Global Failures

### 5.1 The "Emissions Scandal" Chair
In the mid-2010s, an EU automotive company chair faced backlash because he had been on the board when the company installed "cheat software" to bypass emissions tests. 
* **The Conflict:** He was leading the investigation into his own previous oversight. 
* **The Solution:** He had to **recuse** himself (leave the room) during board discussions regarding his own liability.

### 5.2 The Regulator & The Banker
A deputy governor at a central bank failed to declare that her brother was a top executive at a bank she regulated. 
* **The Conflict:** It was impossible to guarantee impartiality. 
* **The Outcome:** She resigned. This highlights that **familial connections** are a major source of perceived and actual COI.

## 6. Managing Conflicts of Interest Ethically
ICT professionals should follow a standardized process to mitigate COI risks.



1.  **Early Identification:** Ask yourself: "Would a neutral outsider think my judgment is biased?"
2.  **Full Disclosure:** Inform your supervisor or ethics board in writing immediately.
3.  **Recusal:** Step away from the specific decision or project where the conflict exists.
4.  **Adhere to Codes of Conduct:** Follow **ACM/IEEE** and **ICT Authority Kenya** guidelines.
5.  **Documentation:** Keep a clear paper trail of how the conflict was identified and managed.

---

## 7. Consequences of Negligence
Failure to manage COI leads to:
* **Legal Prosecution:** Corruption or fraud charges.
* **Project Failure:** Selecting an inferior vendor leads to system crashes.
* **Blacklisting:** Loss of professional license and "unemployability" in the sector.

## 🗣️ Discussion & Activities

### Discussion Questions
1. If you are a freelancer, is it a conflict of interest to use the same "boilerplate" code for two competing clients?
2. Does a small gift (like a branded jacket or a high-end keyboard) from a vendor constitute a conflict of interest for a procurement officer?

### Group Activity: The Recruitment Dilemma (10 mins)
**Scenario:** You are the lead interviewer for a Senior Developer role at a top Kenyan Fintech. Your best friend from university has applied. They are technically the best candidate.
* **Task:** List **four specific actions** you must take to ensure the hiring process remains ethical and defensible to the company board.
