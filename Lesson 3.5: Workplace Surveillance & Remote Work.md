# Lesson 3.5: Workplace Surveillance and Monitoring

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Define** workplace surveillance in modern ICT contexts.
* **Navigate** the legal framework in Kenya (Constitution, DPA 2019, KICA).
* **Identify** the "Red Lines" where monitoring becomes unethical or illegal.
* **Balance** business interests with fundamental human rights.

## 1. The Surveillance Toolkit: How are you being watched?
In a remote or hybrid setup, "walking the floor" has been replaced by digital tracking.

### Common Monitoring Methods:
* **Activity Logs:** Tracking email sent/received and websites visited on company networks.
* **Keystroke Logging:** Recording every single key pressed (extremely intrusive).
* **Screen Capture:** Software that takes random screenshots of your desktop.
* **AI Analytics:** Using algorithms to "score" your productivity or emotional state.
* **CCTV/Webcams:** Using laptop cameras to verify if an employee is at their desk.

## 2. The Kenyan Legal Shield
Employee monitoring is not a "legal vacuum" in Kenya. Three main laws dictate what an employer can and cannot do:

1.  **The Constitution (Article 31):** Every Kenyan has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have their **communications intercepted**.
2.  **Data Protection Act (2019):** This is the primary law. It treats employees as "Data Subjects." Any monitoring must be **Lawful, Fair, and Transparent**.
3.  **KICA (2010):** Prevents the unauthorized interception of electronic communications.

## 3. The "Four Pillars" of Legal Monitoring
For a Kenyan employer to legally monitor a remote worker, they must satisfy these four conditions:

| Pillar | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lawful Basis** | There must be a legitimate reason (e.g., protecting trade secrets or preventing fraud). |
| **Transparency** | You **must** be informed. Secret monitoring is illegal unless criminal activity is suspected. |
| **Proportionality** | Employers must use the *least intrusive* method. (e.g., Checking if a task is done is better than watching you via webcam). |
| **DPIA** | For high-risk tracking (AI or Biometrics), the employer must conduct a **Data Protection Impact Assessment**. |

## 4. Ethical vs. Legal: The "Creep" Factor
Just because a monitoring method is *legal* doesn't mean it is *ethical*. 

> **"Surveillance Creep"** happens when a tool meant for security (e.g., checking for malware) is slowly used for something else (e.g., seeing how many breaks a developer takes).

### The Trust Paradox
* **Heavy Surveillance:** Leads to high stress, "theatre of work" (faking activity), and high staff turnover.
* **Trust-Based Management:** Focuses on **outputs** (is the code finished?) rather than **inputs** (how many keys were pressed at 2:00 PM?).

## 5. Case Example: The "Silent" Tracker
**Scenario:** A Nairobi tech firm installs a silent screen-recording app on all company laptops given to remote staff. They do not mention this in the contracts.
* **The Violation:** Under the **DPA 2019**, this is a failure of **Transparency**. 
* **The Risk:** The firm could be fined up to **Ksh 5 Million** or 1% of their turnover by the ODPC.
* **The Professional Failure:** The ICT manager who implemented this failed their professional duty to ensure the system was "Private by Design."

## 6. Class Activity: The Ethics Consultant
**The Challenge:** Your boss wants to install "Presence Detection" AI that uses webcams to ensure remote workers are at their desks 8 hours a day.

**Your Task:** 1.  Explain to your boss why this might violate the **DPA 2019 Principle of Proportionality**.
2.  Propose an alternative (e.g., GitHub commit frequency or Jira task completion).

## 7. Summary
* **Monitoring is allowed**, but it is not a "free-for-all."
* **Consent & Policy** are mandatory.
* **Outputs > Surveillance.** Ethical ICT professionals build systems that respect human dignity.
