## 2. Legal Foundations in Kenya
Trademarks are governed by the **Trademarks Act (Cap 506)** and administered by the **Kenya Industrial Property Institute (KIPI)**.

### Infringement vs. Passing Off
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Trademark Infringement** applies to *registered* marks. It is a statutory violation where you only need to prove the other party used a confusingly similar mark.
>
> **Passing Off** protects *unregistered* marks under common law. You must prove you have a reputation (Goodwill) and that the defendant's actions caused actual damage.

## 3. Case Study: M-KOPA vs. MKopo Kastomer Care (2025)
This recent case demonstrates how the High Court of Kenya protects established fintech brands from "imitative" branding.

### Facts & Context
* **Plaintiff:** M-KOPA Kenya Limited (Asset financing and fintech giant).
* **Defendant:** John Waweru Njenga, operating as **"MKopo Kastomer Care & Accessories."**
* **The Conflict:** M-KOPA alleged that the defendant’s name and logo were so similar that they caused **brand dilution** and led customers to believe the two businesses were affiliated.

### The Court's Decision (January 2025)
The High Court (Commercial & Tax Division) ruled in favor of M-KOPA:
1. **Confusing Similarity:** Judge Peter Mulwa noted that "MKopo" (Swahili for loan) and "M-KOPA" were strikingly similar in look and sound.
2. **The "Average Customer" Test:** The court ruled that an average customer might not immediately discern the difference, creating a risk of confusion.
3. **The Injunction:** The defendant was ordered to cease using the name and logo immediately to stop "riding on the success" of the established brand.

## 4. Professional Implications for ICT Practitioners

| Issue | Professional Best Practice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Naming an App** | Perform a KIPI trademark search before finalizing your app's name or logo. |
| **Choosing Colors** | Avoid using exact HEX codes of competitors (e.g., using "Safaricom Green" for a new telco app). |
| **Domain Squatting** | Do not register domain names that include a competitor's trademark (e.g., `mkopa-deals.com`). |
| **White-Labeling** | Ensure you have a clear license before using another company's trademarked API or branding in your software. |

## 🗣️ Discussion & Activity

### Discussion Prompt
*In the M-KOPA case, the word "Mkopo" is a common Swahili word for "loan." Should companies be allowed to stop others from using common words in their business names? Why or why not?*

### Activity: The "Rebrand" Challenge
1. Find a local small business that uses a logo similar to a global brand (e.g., a local café using the Starbucks "Siren" style).
2. Draft a 3-step **Rebranding Plan** for them that keeps their local identity while avoiding a potential Trademark Infringement lawsuit.
