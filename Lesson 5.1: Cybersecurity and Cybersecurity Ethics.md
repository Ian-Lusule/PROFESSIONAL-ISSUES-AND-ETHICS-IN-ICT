# Lesson 5.1: Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity Ethics

## 🎯 Lesson Objectives
* **Define** cybersecurity and distinguish it from cybercrime.
* **Analyze** the scale of cyber threats globally and within the Kenyan context.
* **Identify** the core responsibilities of ICT professionals in safeguarding systems.
* **Evaluate** the ethics of surveillance and whistleblowing through real-life cases.

## 1. What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

### The CIA Triad
The foundation of cybersecurity is built on three pillars:
1. **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is accessible only to those authorized to have it.
2. **Integrity:** Ensuring data is accurate and has not been tampered with.
3. **Availability:** Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

## 2. The Kenyan Context: A Rising Threat
Kenya is a regional leader in digitalization, which also makes it a major target for cybercrime.

* **Statistical Spike:** In 2023, the **Communications Authority of Kenya (CA)** recorded over **900 million cyber threat incidents**, largely due to the proliferation of insecure IoT devices and sophisticated system attacks.
* **Top Threats:** Mobile money fraud (targeting M-Pesa), ransomware on SMEs, and DDoS attacks on government portals like **eCitizen**.
* **National Response:** The government established the **National KE-CIRT/CC** to coordinate incident responses 24/7.

## 3. Key Areas of Cybersecurity Operation

| Area | Focus | Kenyan Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Network Security** | Protecting traffic and access. | Safaricom's firewall & VPN protocols. |
| **Information Security** | Protecting data at rest. | Banking encryption for customer data. |
| **Application Security** | Finding software bugs. | Securing the **Huduma** app. |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Analyzing emerging attack patterns. | National KE-CIRT/CC advisories. |
| **Digital Forensics** | Investigating after a breach. | **DCI Cybercrime Unit** analysis. |

## 4. Case Study 1: The "Optimus 3.0" Debate
**Context:** To combat rising cyber-fraud and terrorism, reports indicate the **Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)** utilizes advanced surveillance tools, sometimes referred to as "Optimus."

### The Ethical Conflict
* **Security Side (Utilitarian):** These systems are vital for national defense and catching digital fraudsters before they steal billions from citizens.
* **Privacy Side (Deontological):** Mass surveillance may violate **Article 31 of the Constitution of Kenya** (Right to Privacy) if conducted without clear judicial oversight or public transparency.
* **Professional Duty:** ICT professionals working on such systems must ensure they comply with the **Data Protection Act (2019)**, ensuring data is not misused for political or personal gain.

## 5. Case Study 2: Edward Snowden & Whistleblowing (2013)
Edward Snowden, a contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA), leaked documents exposing mass global surveillance.

* **The Dilemma:** Snowden broke his professional **Confidentiality Agreement** (Legal duty) to reveal what he believed was an unconstitutional violation of **Public Privacy** (Moral duty).
* **The Lesson:** Cybersecurity ethics often involves a conflict of loyalties. Professionals must decide if their primary duty is to their employer or to the public good.

---

## 6. Professional Codes of Conduct
As a cybersecurity professional, you are guided by:
* **ACM/IEEE Codes:** "Avoid harm to others" and "Respect privacy."
* **Kenya Data Protection Act:** Requires reporting breaches within **72 hours**.
* **Integrity:** Never "testing" a system for vulnerabilities without written authorization (this is hacking, regardless of intent).

## 🗣️ Discussion & Activities

### Discussion Prompt
*If you discovered a vulnerability in a major Kenyan bank's app, but you didn't have permission to test it, would you report it? How would you do so without being accused of a crime under the **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act**?*

### Group Activity: The Ethical Audit (10 mins)
**Scenario:** You are hired to secure a government database. You find an old log that shows a high-ranking official has been accessing citizens' private data without a warrant.
1. Identify the **conflicting duties** (Loyalty to employer vs. Legal compliance).
2. Propose a **legal and ethical pathway** for reporting this discovery.
