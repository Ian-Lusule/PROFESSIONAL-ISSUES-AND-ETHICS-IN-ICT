# Lesson 2.1: Ethics, Morals, and Law in ICT Practice

## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Define** ethics, morals, and law, and explain how they differ.
* **Analyze** the relationship and tensions between what is legal and what is ethical.
* **Apply** these concepts to ICT practice using a real-life case study.
* **Critically reflect** on how ICT professionals should navigate dilemmas involving competing legal and ethical demands.

## 1. Understanding the Key Concepts

### a) Morals
* **Definition:** Personal principles or beliefs about what is right and wrong.
* **Source:** Shaped by culture, religion, upbringing, and personal philosophy.
* **Example:** Personally believing it is wrong to read a colleague's emails, even if you have the administrative access to do so.

### b) Ethics
* **Definition:** Shared standards of behavior within a profession or society.
* **Source:** Professional bodies and agreed-upon frameworks.
* **Example:** Adhering to the ACM or ICTAK codes of conduct that mandate user privacy and data confidentiality.

### c) Law
* **Definition:** Formal rules enacted by governments and enforced by authorities.
* **Source:** Legislation and judicial systems.
* **Example:** **Kenya’s Data Protection Act 2019**, which regulates how personal data is collected and stored.



### 🔑 Key Distinction
| Concept | Perspective | Driver |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Morals** | Individual Conscience | "I feel this is wrong." |
| **Ethics** | Professional Consensus | "As ICT workers, we agree this is wrong." |
| **Law** | Government Mandate | "The state says this is wrong/illegal." |

## 2. The Relationship Between Ethics and Law

They often overlap, but they are not identical. Understanding the "Grey Areas" is critical for a professional:

* **Legal but Unethical:** Mass surveillance that is technically allowed under a vague security law but violates fundamental human privacy.
* **Ethical but Illegal:** A "whistleblower" who leaks proof of corporate harm. They break a Non-Disclosure Agreement (illegal) to protect the public (ethical).
* **Moral but Unethical:** A "hacktivist" who feels morally justified in crashing a site for a cause, yet violates professional codes regarding system integrity.

## 3. Case Study: The FlexiSpy/DCI Surveillance Incident (2024)

### Background
In 2024, **Citizen Lab** alleged that Kenya’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) installed **FlexiSpy spyware** on the phones of journalists involved in the BBC Africa documentary *"Blood Parliament."* This reportedly occurred after their arrest, sparking a major debate on state overreach.

### The Dilemma
* **Legality:** Security agencies may argue surveillance is permitted under national security provisions.
* **Ethics:** Professional codes demand that ICT workers protect privacy and avoid harm. Assisting in targeted surveillance of journalists contradicts these codes.
* **Morals:** Public outcry suggested that many citizens viewed this as fundamentally "wrong," regardless of what the law stated.

### Questions for Reflection
1. Was it ethical for the ICT professionals (developers or technicians) to assist in deploying this spyware?
2. If you were the system administrator asked to facilitate this, where would you draw the line?

## 4. Lessons for ICT Professionals

* **Beyond Compliance:** Ethical responsibility often requires more than just "following the law."
* **Frameworks Matter:** Use codes of ethics (ACM, IEEE, ICTA) as your shield when facing pressure from employers or governments.
* **Long-term Credibility:** Upholding ethics protects public trust in technology, which is more valuable than short-term legal or political protection.

> **Final Thought:** In the digital era, just because we **can** build it or deploy it, doesn't mean we **should**.
