# Lesson 2.3: Ethical Theories – The Huduma Namba Case

## 1. Background of Huduma Namba
Launched in 2019, **Huduma Namba** (National Integrated Identity Management System - NIIMS) aimed to create a "single source of truth" by consolidating biometric and personal data into one unique identifier.

### The Promises vs. The Challenges
* **Promise:** Efficiency, reduced fraud (ghost workers), and seamless access to NHIF, NSSF, and other government services.
* **Challenge:** Data privacy alarms (collecting DNA and GPS without a framework), high risks of exclusion for marginalized groups, and a lack of a Data Protection Act at the time of launch.

## 2. Applying Ethical Theories

### a) Utilitarianism (The "Greatest Good")
**Focus:** The benefits for the majority of the population.
* **The Argument:** If 90% of Kenyans receive faster healthcare and the government saves billions by eliminating "ghost workers," the system is ethical.
* **The ICT Perspective:** Professionals might justify data centralization as the most efficient way to serve 50 million people.
* **Critique:** Utilitarianism can sometimes ignore the "pain" of the minority (e.g., the 5 million Kenyans at risk of exclusion due to lack of existing documentation).

### b) Deontology (The "Duty and Rules" View)
**Focus:** Universal rights and legal/moral obligations.
* **The Argument:** Individuals have an inherent **right to privacy**. Proceeding without a Data Protection Law is a breach of duty, regardless of how much money it saves.
* **The ICT Perspective:** Following the **ACM Code (2.3: Respect Existing Rules)**, professionals should have insisted on a legal framework *before* collecting sensitive biometrics.
* **Impact:** The High Court's decision to halt the rollout until the **Data Protection Act 2019** was implemented was a classic "Deontological" victory.

### c) Virtue Ethics (The "Character" View)
**Focus:** The integrity and transparency of the professionals involved.
* **The Argument:** An ethical professional doesn't just "follow orders"—they act with **prudence** and **honesty**.
* **The ICT Perspective:** Virtuous developers would have advocated for "Privacy by Design," ensuring the system was built to be inclusive and secure from day one, rather than trying to fix it after public outcry.

## 3. Comparison of Ethical Lenses on Huduma Namba

| Theory | Verdict | Primary Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Utilitarianism** | ✅ **Justified** | High efficiency and national security benefits for the majority. |
| **Deontology** | ❌ **Unethical** | Violated the duty to protect privacy rights and follow due process. |
| **Virtue Ethics** | ⚠️ **Questionable** | Success depended on the transparency and integrity of the leaders/devs. |

## 4. Key Takeaways for ICT Professionals
* **Efficiency is not Ethics:** A system that works perfectly well (technically) can still be a failure (ethically).
* **The Law is the Minimum:** As seen in the court cases, just because the government "orders" a system doesn't mean it meets the higher standards of professional ethics.
* **Balanced Decision-Making:** You must weigh the **outcomes** (Utility), the **rules** (Deontology), and your own **professional integrity** (Virtue).

## 5. Summary Statistics: The Scale of Responsibility
To understand why these theories matter, consider the data at stake during the Huduma Namba rollout:

* **37 Million+**: Kenyans registered during the mass exercise.
* **5 Million**: Estimated number of people at risk of "digital exclusion" due to existing ID hurdles.
* **DNA & GPS**: Data points originally requested but later ruled **unconstitutional** due to their intrusive nature.

> **Reflective Question:** If you were the lead database architect for NIIMS, would you have voiced concerns about the collection of GPS and DNA data?
