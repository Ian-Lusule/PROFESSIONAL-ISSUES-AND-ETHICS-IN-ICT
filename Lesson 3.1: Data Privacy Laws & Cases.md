# Lesson 3.1: Data Privacy Laws (Case Study Overview)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Define** data privacy and its criticality in ICT.
* **Identify** core principles of GDPR and the Kenya Data Protection Act (DPA) 2019.
* **Analyze** real-world cases (Worldcoin & Huduma Namba) where privacy failures led to legal intervention.
* **Reflect** on the professional requirement for Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA).

## 1. Introduction: Why Data Privacy Matters
In the digital economy, **"Data is the new oil."** It is immensely valuable but highly volatile. 
* **The Risk:** Misuse leads to identity theft, financial loss (e.g., Fuliza fraud), and systemic loss of public trust.
* **The Professional Duty:** ICT workers are the "gatekeepers" of this data. Your technical choices determine whether a system is a fortress or a sieve.

## 2. Comparing Global and Local Frameworks
Kenya’s **Data Protection Act 2019** is heavily modeled after the EU’s **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lawfulness & Fairness** | Data must be collected with valid legal grounds and clear consent. |
| **Purpose Limitation** | Data collected for one reason (e.g., NHIF) cannot be used for another (e.g., targeted ads) without consent. |
| **Data Minimization** | Collect only what is strictly necessary. (e.g., Do you really need a user's GPS for a calculator app?) |
| **Accuracy** | Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure personal data is kept up to date. |
| **Storage Limitation** | Data should not be kept longer than necessary for its intended purpose. |
| **Integrity & Confidentiality** | Use technical measures (encryption, access controls) to secure data. |

## 3. Case Study I: Worldcoin (The "Eyeball" Scan)
In 2023, **Worldcoin** offered ~Ksh 7,000 in crypto tokens to Kenyans in exchange for an iris scan to create a "World ID."

### The Lapses:
1. **Consent vs. Inducement:** Was consent "freely given" if participants were swayed by a financial reward in a struggling economy?
2. **Missing DPIA:** Worldcoin failed to submit a **Data Protection Impact Assessment** before starting large-scale biometric collection.
3. **Cross-Border Transfer:** Sensitive biometric data was sent outside Kenya without adequate legal safeguards.

**The Outcome:** The High Court ordered the suspension of registrations and the **permanent deletion** of all collected biometric data within 7 days.

## 4. Case Study II: Huduma Namba (NIIMS)
A government initiative to create a central digital ID for all residents.

### The Lapses:
* **Legal Prematurity:** The project was rolled out *before* the Data Protection Act was fully operational.
* **Invasive Data:** Attempted collection of **DNA and GPS** data was ruled "intrusive and unnecessary" by the courts.
* **Exclusion Risk:** Marginalized groups (e.g., Nubians) faced "digital invisibility" if they couldn't meet the strict registration requirements.

**The Outcome:** In October 2021, the High Court declared the rollout **illegal** because the government skipped the mandatory **DPIA** required under Section 31 of the DPA.

## 5. The Critical Tool: What is a DPIA?
A **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** is a systematic process to identify and minimize privacy risks. It is **mandatory** for high-risk projects.



### When is a DPIA required?
* When using **new technologies** (AI, Biometrics).
* When processing data on a **large scale** (National IDs).
* When processing **sensitive data** (Health, Religion, DNA).

## 6. Summary for ICT Professionals
* **Legality vs. Ethics:** A project might be "ordered" by a boss or government, but it can still be unethical and illegal if privacy rights are ignored.
* **Foreseeable Risk:** As a professional, you must advocate for a DPIA *before* the first line of code is written or the first user is registered.
* **Societal Impact:** Your work impacts human rights. Safeguarding data is safeguarding people.
