# Lesson 1.3: ICTAK Code of Ethics

The **Information Communication Technology Association of Kenya (ICTAK)** Code of Ethics represents a dedication to ethical behavior among members. It serves as a regulatory framework to ensure that ICT practitioners in Kenya uphold the honor, dignity, and effectiveness of the profession.

## Core Pillars of the ICTAK Code
The code is built upon several foundational commitments that every member must adopt:

1.  **Public Interest:** Placing the interests of the community above personal or sectional interests.
2.  **Integrity & Honesty:** Being truthful in representing skills, products, and services.
3.  **Competence:** Working diligently and continuing to upgrade professional knowledge and skills.
4.  **Security & Privacy:** Preserving the integrity, security, and confidentiality of the information of others.
5.  **Professional Responsibility:** Accepting full responsibility for one's work and avoiding dishonest or fraudulent practices.

## Detailed Standards of Conduct

The ICTAK code provides specific behavioral guidelines categorized by the professional's relationship with different stakeholders:

### 1. Responsibility to Clients and Employers
* **Value for Money:** Provide products and services that match the operational and financial needs of clients.
* **Transparency:** Advise clients/employers when a proposed project is not in their best interest.
* **Conflict of Interest:** Disclose any potential conflicts between assignments and legal or community requirements.
* **Honest Estimates:** Provide realistic project timelines and costings.
* **Objective Opinions:** Give unbiased and objective advice, qualifying opinions based on limited knowledge.

### 2. Responsibility to the Community
* **Quality of Life:** Strive to enhance the quality of life and satisfy the needs of those affected by your work.
* **Health & Safety:** Protect and promote the health and safety of the public.
* **Privacy:** Respect and consider people’s privacy in all technical implementations.
* **Inclusivity:** Endeavour to understand the perceptions and feelings of control of those affected by your systems.



### 3. Responsibility to the Profession
* **Professional Development:** Continue to upgrade your own skills and encourage the development of colleagues and students.
* **Reputation:** Do not attempt to enhance your own reputation at the expense of another professional's reputation.
* **Whistleblowing:** Take appropriate action upon discovering unethical behavior by other members and expose unethical practices.
* **Peer Respect:** Seek professional opinions from colleagues in their areas of competence and give credit where it is due.

## The "Spirit" of the Code
The ICTAK code acknowledges that no list of rules is exhaustive. Members are expected to:
* **Go beyond the brief:** If acting professionally requires more than what is in a contract, the professional should do so.
* **Observe Professional Distance:** Maintain distance from individuals whose membership was terminated due to unethical conduct.
* **Seek Advice:** Contact the Association when faced with an ethical dilemma that is difficult to resolve individually.

> **Note:** The fact that a member follows these standards does not automatically guarantee ethical behavior. A member must always act in the **spirit** of the code to resolve ambiguous or contentious issues.
