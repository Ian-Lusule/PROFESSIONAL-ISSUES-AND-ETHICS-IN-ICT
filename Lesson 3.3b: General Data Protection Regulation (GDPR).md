# Lesson 3.3b: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* **Define** GDPR and its global purpose.
* **Identify** the seven core principles of data processing.
* **Explain** the rights granted to "Data Subjects" (individuals).
* **Understand** the heavy obligations for organizations.
* **Reflect** on how GDPR serves as the blueprint for Kenya's Data Protection Act.

## 1. 🌍 Background: A Global Standard
Implemented on **May 25, 2018**, the GDPR replaced outdated 1995 laws to address modern threats like big data, social media profiling, and massive data breaches. 

**Why does it matter in Kenya?**
The GDPR has **Extra-territorial Effect**. This means if a Kenyan tourism company or a local tech startup processes the data of someone living in the EU, that Kenyan company **must** comply with GDPR or face massive international fines.

## 2. ⚖️ The 7 Core Principles of GDPR
These principles are the "North Star" for any ICT professional designing a system.



| Principle | Professional Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Lawfulness, Fairness, Transparency** | Don't hide what you are doing with data in 50-page legal documents. |
| **Purpose Limitation** | If you collect an email for a password reset, don't use it for a newsletter later. |
| **Data Minimization** | Don't ask for "Gender" or "Home Address" if you're just building a weather app. |
| **Accuracy** | Give users a way to update their info if it changes. |
| **Storage Limitation** | Set an "expiry date" for data. Delete inactive accounts after a certain period. |
| **Integrity & Confidentiality** | Use encryption (AES-256) and secure servers to prevent leaks. |
| **Accountability** | You must be able to *prove* you followed the rules (logs, audits, DPO). |

## 3. 👩‍💻 Rights of the Data Subject
GDPR shifts power from corporations back to the people. 



* **Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):** You can demand a company delete all your data if it's no longer needed.
* **Right to Data Portability:** You can ask for your data in a "structured, machine-readable format" (like a .CSV) to move it to a competitor.
* **Automated Decision-Making:** You have the right to demand a **human review** if an AI (like a loan-approval bot) rejects your application.

## 4. 🏢 Obligations of Organizations
As an ICT professional, you are responsible for implementing these "By Design":

1.  **Privacy by Design:** Privacy shouldn't be an "add-on." It must be part of the initial code architecture.
2.  **72-Hour Breach Rule:** If your database is hacked, you have exactly **72 hours** to notify the regulator.
3.  **Data Protection Officer (DPO):** Large organizations must hire a dedicated expert to oversee privacy.

## 5. 🚨 Real-World Enforcement (The Cost of Failure)
GDPR is famous for its "teeth"—fines can reach **€20 Million** or **4% of global turnover**.

| Organization | Fine | Reason for Fine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Meta (Facebook)** | **€1.2 Billion** (2023) | Unlawful transfer of EU user data to US servers. |
| **Amazon** | **€746 Million** | Non-compliant cookie tracking for targeted ads. |
| **TikTok** | **€345 Million** | Failure to protect children's data and "public-by-default" settings. |
| **Google** | **€50 Million** | Lack of transparency in personalized ad settings. |

## 6. 🌍 GDPR vs. Kenya’s DPA 2019
* **The Connection:** Kenya's Law is a "child" of the GDPR. Most of our sections on rights and principles are copied almost word-for-word.
* **The Difference:** While GDPR has issued billions in fines, Kenya's **Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC)** is still in the early stages of enforcement, though it is becoming more active (e.g., recent fines against schools and digital lenders).

> **ICT Pro Tip:** If you build your systems to be **GDPR-compliant**, you are automatically compliant with the Kenya Data Protection Act.
